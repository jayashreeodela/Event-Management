# 🎉 Event Management System

## 📋 Overview
The **Event Management System** is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of organizing and managing events.  
It allows event organizers to create, update, and manage events, while users can browse available events, register, and view event details.

This project demonstrates the use of **frontend and backend technologies** to build a complete web solution.

## 🚀 Features
- Event creation, editing, and deletion
- User registration for events
- Display of event listings with details
- Input validation and error handling
- Responsive design for different devices
- Admin and user interfaces (can be extended)

## 🧠 Objectives
- To understand the full-stack web development process  
- To apply CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations  
- To learn frontend-backend communication using Java and HTML  
- To practice form validation, session management, and database handling
